> A dynamic web platform for discovering and listing vacation rentals worldwide.
This project is a comprehensive **Vacation Rental Marketplace** designed to facilitate the connection between hosts and travelers. It provides a seamless interface for users to publish their own rental listings, manage availability, and explore unique stays across different locations.
Beyond basic CRUD functionalities, the application features a robust review system, secure user authentication, and data persistence, demonstrating a complete full-stack implementation using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.
